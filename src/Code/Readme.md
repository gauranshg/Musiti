## Hello, Welcome to Musiti!

Musiti is a platform to convert your basic SVG files to audio files!
Yup you read it right, convert images to audio files. So!! How does it work you may ask!
You can upload you own SVG images into the website and we will convert it to a stereo WAV file.
The Stereo Wavfile can then be played on a vectoroscope.
